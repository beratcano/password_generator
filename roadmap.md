# Roadmap for a Rust Password Generator with Encrypted Saving and Clipboard Functionality

**Target Language:** Rust

**Important Note:** Building a GUI application with these features in Rust within the next two days is very ambitious. Consider starting with a command-line interface (CLI) version first to get the core logic working.

**Phase 1: Core Password Generation**

1.  **Set up a Rust Project:** Create a new Rust project.
2.  **Add Random Number Generation Dependency:** Include a crate for generating random numbers in your project's dependencies.
3.  **Implement Password Generation Logic:**
    * Write a function to generate random passwords of a specified length.
    * Allow the user to input the desired password length.
    * Print the generated password to the output (console for CLI, text field for GUI).

4.  **Character Set Customization (Optional but Recommended):**
    * Enhance the password generation function to allow the user to select which character sets to use (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special symbols). Provide a way for the user to specify these preferences (e.g., command-line arguments or prompts for CLI, checkboxes or toggles for GUI).

**Phase 2: Password Saving (Encrypted File)**

1.  **Choose an Encryption Crate:** Select a suitable crate for symmetric encryption in Rust and add it to your project's dependencies.
2.  **Implement Master Password Handling:**
    * Prompt the user to enter a master password.
    * Securely derive an encryption key from this master password using a key derivation function.
3.  **Implement Encryption and Saving Logic:**
    * When the user wants to save a password, prompt for a label/identifier.
    * Encrypt the label and the generated password using the derived key.
    * Serialize the encrypted data and save it to a local file.
4.  **Implement Decryption and Retrieval Logic:**
    * When the user wants to retrieve a password, prompt for the master password.
    * Derive the key again.
    * Read the encrypted data from the file.
    * Deserialize and decrypt the data.
    * Display the retrieved password to the user.

**Phase 3: User Interface (Optional - CLI Recommended for Time)**

1.  **Choose a GUI Framework (If Desired):** Select a Rust GUI framework if you plan to build a graphical interface.
2.  **Design and Build GUI Elements:** Create the necessary windows, buttons, and input/output fields for password generation, saving, and retrieval.
3.  **Integrate Logic with GUI:** Connect the GUI elements to the password generation and saving/retrieval functions.

**Phase 4: Clipboard Functionality (If GUI is Attempted)**

1.  **Add Clipboard Dependency:** Include a crate for interacting with the system clipboard in your project.
2.  **Implement "Copy to Clipboard" Feature:** Add a button or functionality in the GUI to copy the displayed password to the clipboard.

**Phase 5: Documentation and Testing**

* Add comments to your Rust code.
* Test all functionalities thoroughly.

**Important Security Notes:**

* The security of this application relies heavily on the strength of the master password.
* This is a simplified implementation for personal use within a limited timeframe. For critical security needs, use established password management solutions.
* Be cautious when choosing and using cryptography-related dependencies.
